# Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

 Development of a fast, interactive, and effortless frontend for the user.
   1. React
    - A JavaScript library that helps build user interfaces. It allows the implementation
      of reusable UI components, making the development process more
      efficient and the code more readable.
  2. TypeScript
    - A statically typed and compiled extension of JavaScript that increases the quality
      and maintainability of code by detecting and capturing errors
  3. Vite
    - A build tool that accelerates development by cutting down modern web projects' and
      build times.

**Backend:** 

To solve the backend logic, develop front-end APIs to interact with and
             manage linguistic processing through LangChain.

   1. FastAPI
    - A web framework based on python3 enables users to quickly and easily build APIs  
      for their web applications.
    - Develop front-end APIs to interact with and manage linguistic processing through
      LangChain.

   2. LangChain
    - A Python framework for creating apps stacking multiple language models in a single
      pipeline. Its purpose is to offer a simple way of integrating
      language models into apps and other types of software, granting increased text 
      processing capacities.
    - To process and manipulate natural language text, enhancing the application's ability 
      to handle user inputs and provide meaningful responses.

   3. MongoDB
    - A NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. It stores 
      data in JSON-like documents, making it a natural fit for applications
that handle various data types.
    - To store user information, messages, and processed text efficiently, reliably, and 
      safely.

   4. Docker
    - A system that allows developers to package applications into 
      containers - standardized software elements that include everything that the 
      applications, such as libraries and dependencies, need to work.
    - To containerize the FastAPI application, making it compatible with different 
      environments and more easily deployable.

   5. AWS Lambda
    - A serverless computing service that runs code responding to events and automatically 
      manages the underlying computing resources.
    - To provide the FastAPI backend in a serverless fashion, enabling the application to 
      scale automatically depending on the load.
